<blockquote>
"Albert Einstein's quote "Memory is deceptive because it is colored by
today's events" suggests that our memories are not always reliable because
they can be influenced by our current thoughts and experiences. In other
words, what we remember from the past may be distorted or biased by our
present perceptions and emotions. This quote highlights the fallibility of
memory and the importance of recognizing its limitations when trying to
understand the past." - ChatGPT
